cfCodeREADr
===========

cfCodeREADr is an API integration with mobile scanner software provider CodeREADr.com

This set of models and ColdFusion API wraps the native CodeREADr API in a reusable and expandable way and makes it easy 
to implement the CodeREADr API with your ColdFusion development efforts.

An example implementation of using the cfCodeREADr API is included for reference purposes. Though this is non-working
code due to dependencies not included with this package, it serves as a well rounded example of how to implement the
cfCodeREADr API in your applications.
